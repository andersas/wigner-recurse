# wigner-recurse
Calculation of Wigner 3j and 6j symbols using recursion.

Functions for calculating angular momentum coupling coefficients using
recurrsion relations. The algorithms used are those of Schulten and
Gordon[1] augmented with the relations of Luscombe and
Luben[2]. Commentary throughout refers to the paper of Luscombe and
Luben (LL98).

This code is in embryonic form at this point in time.
